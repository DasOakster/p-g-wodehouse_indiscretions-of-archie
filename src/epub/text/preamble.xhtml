			<p>It wasn’t Archie’s fault really. It’s true he went to America and fell in love with Lucille, the daughter of a millionaire hotel proprietor and if he did marry her⁠—well, what else was there to do?</p>
			<p>From his point of view, the whole thing was a thoroughly good egg; but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brewster, his father-in-law, thought differently, Archie had neither money nor occupation, which was distasteful in the eyes of the industrious <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Brewster; but the real bar was the fact that he had once adversely criticised one of his hotels.</p>
			<p>Archie does his best to heal the breach; but, being something of an ass, genus priceless, he finds it almost beyond his powers to placate “the man-eating fish” whom Providence has given him as a father-in-law</p>

			<p class="center">DEDICATION<br/>
			TO<br/>
			B. W. KING-HALL</p>
			<p>My dear Buddy⁠—</p>
			<p>We have been friends for eighteen years. A considerable proportion of my books were written under your hospitable roof. And yet I have never dedicated one to you. What will be the verdict of Posterity on this? The fact is, I have become rather superstitious about dedications. No sooner do you label a book with the legend⁠—</p>
			<p>TO MY<br/>
			BEST FRIEND<br/>
			<span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span></p>
			<p>than <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> cuts you in Piccadilly, or you bring a lawsuit against him. There is a fatality about it. However, I can’t imagine anyone quarrelling with you, and I am getting more attractive all the time, so let’s take a chance.</p>
			<p>Yours ever,<br/>
			P. G. WODEHOUSE.</p>
